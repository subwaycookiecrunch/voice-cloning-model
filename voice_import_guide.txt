# Step-by-Step Voice Cloning Guide for MP3 Files

## Step 1: Create Proper Folder Structure
1. Create these folders if they don't exist:
   - C:\Users\raj97\OneDrive\Desktop\voice-cloning\dataset
   - C:\Users\raj97\OneDrive\Desktop\voice-cloning\dataset\target
   - C:\Users\raj97\OneDrive\Desktop\voice-cloning\dataset\source

## Step 2: Prepare Your MP3 Voice File
1. Find the MP3 file you want to clone
2. Copy it to C:\Users\raj97\OneDrive\Desktop\voice-cloning\dataset\target
3. Make sure the MP3 file has a .mp3 extension
4. For best results, your MP3 file should:
   - Be clear with minimal background noise
   - Contain at least 1-2 minutes of speech
   - Be of reasonable quality (128kbps or higher)

## Step 3: Run the Application
1. Open Command Prompt
2. Navigate to your project folder:
   ```
   cd C:\Users\raj97\OneDrive\Desktop\voice-cloning
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```
   python voice_cloning_app.py
   ```

## Step 4: Import the Target Voice in the Application
1. In the "Data Collection" tab:
   - Click "Browse" next to "Target Voice (Voice to Clone)"
   - Navigate to C:\Users\raj97\OneDrive\Desktop\voice-cloning\dataset\target
   - Select the folder (not the MP3 file itself)
   - Click "Import Target Voice Data"

## Step 5: Add Source Voice Data (Required)
1. Option 1 - Record your voice directly:
   - In the "Data Collection" tab, under "Source Voice"
   - Click "Start Recording"
   - Speak clearly for at least 30 seconds
   - Click "Stop Recording"
   - Click "Import Source Voice Data"

2. Option 2 - Use existing recordings:
   - Place your audio files in C:\Users\raj97\OneDrive\Desktop\voice-cloning\dataset\source
   - In the application, browse to this folder
   - Click "Import Source Voice Data"

## Step 6: Train the Model
1. Go to the "Training" tab
2. Enter a model name (e.g., "my_voice_model")
3. Set training epochs (start with 100)
4. Click "Start Training"
5. Wait for training to complete

## Step 7: Use the Trained Model
1. Go to the "Voice Conversion" tab
2. Click "Load Trained Model"
3. Choose your trained model
4. Click "Record for Conversion" or "Convert from File"
5. Adjust pitch if needed
6. Click "Play Converted" to hear the result

## Troubleshooting:
- If "Import Target Voice Data" fails:
  - Check that your MP3 file is in the correct folder
  - Try converting your MP3 to WAV format first
  - Ensure the MP3 file isn't corrupted

- If training fails:
  - Ensure both target and source data are properly imported
  - Check for error messages in the console
  - Make sure you have enough disk space

- If conversion doesn't sound good:
  - Try adjusting the pitch shift
  - Provide more training data
  - Increase the number of training epochs
